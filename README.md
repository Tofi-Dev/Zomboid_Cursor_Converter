Make custom cursors for project zomboid!

## Why?

Due to a bug in the game's engine, the cursor's red and blue channels are flipped.
I've made this tool to provide a temporary fix.

## How to use:

- Pick your images directory you wish to be your cursor.
- Convert the Image
- Go to media/ui of your Project Zomboid Folder.
- Replace cursor_white.png with your converted one.

## Required Packages for running directly from source:

- FreeSimpleGUI
- OpenCV-Python

## NOTES:
I'm not affliated with The Indie Stone.
This tool might be useless in Build 42 if they decide to fix the bug.
